              <h5>MY BIKE USING THE RACE AND RIDES</h5>
              <p>There are many reasons why cycling can bring happiness to people. First and foremost, cycling is a form of physical activity
                 that can release endorphins, which are the body's natural "feel-good" chemicals. This can help to boost mood, reduce stress
                  and anxiety, and increase overall well-being.In addition to the physical benefits, cycling can also bring a sense of 
                  freedom and adventure. When you're cycling, you have the opportunity to explore new places, take in beautiful scenery,
                   and experience the world in a unique way. Whether you're commuting to work, running errands, or simply taking a leisurely
                    ride, cycling can be an opportunity to escape from the routine and monotony of daily life.</p>

              <h5>PINTUYAN</h5>
              <p>Pintuyan, officially the Municipality of Pintuyan (Cebuano: Lungsod sa Pintuyan; Tagalog: Bayan ng Pintuyan), is a 5th class
                 municipality in the province of Southern Leyte, Philippines and was established in 1865. During the American regime, the 
                 seat of Pintuyan was moved to Pintuyan from San Ricardo upon the election of Perfecto Vazquez as Municipal President.
                  From then on the residents of barrio San Ricardo petitioned for a separate municipality. According to the 2020 census, 
                  it has a population of 10,202 people</p>

              <h5>TEAM CYCLING</h5>
              <p>Team cycling can take many forms, from casual group rides to more competitive events. Many cycling clubs and teams organize
                 regular rides and training sessions, giving members the opportunity to improve their skills and build their fitness levels.
                  Some teams also participate in races and other competitive events, providing a chance to test their abilities against other
                   teams and riders.</p>

            <h5>SOUTHERN PACIFIC CYCLING CLUB (SPCC)</h5>
            <p>Team cycling, also known as group cycling, is a popular form of cycling that involves riding with others as part of a team or
               group. This can be a fun and rewarding way to experience the sport, allowing riders to build camaraderie, push themselves to 
               new levels of performance, and achieve shared goals.One of the key benefits of team cycling is the social aspect. Riding with 
              others can be a great way to meet new people who share your interests and passions. It can also be an opportunity to learn 
              from more experienced riders and to share your own knowledge and skills with others.Another advantage of team cycling is the 
              motivation and support that comes from being part of a group. When you're riding with others, you can encourage each other to 
              push harder and reach new levels of performance. This can be particularly helpful for riders who struggle with motivation or
               who are working to achieve specific goals</p>

            <h5>LIBAGON</h5>
            <p>The Dagohoy revolt prompted more Boholanos to settle the southern towns of Leyte, especially in Hilongos, Bato, Matalom, Maasin, Macrohon,
               Malitbog and Hinunangan. In 1771, seventeen families from the different towns of Bohol migrated to the southeastern coast of Sogod. 
               These families founded the visita (satellite barrio with chapel) of Libagon. Andres Espina, a resident of Tamolayag (now the town of
                Padre Burgos), Malitbog, was invited to instruct the children how to read and write. Despite its growing population, Libagon was only
                 recognized as a visita of Sogod sometime in 1850. [13 Gan, Edito. "Sogod of our Memories: A Special History-Genealogy Account", Sogod
